Add auto intake using google coral
Tune the vision stdDevs so that it is very accurate:
    Trust less during auto and more during teleop maybe
Make sure that everything works from both blue side and red side
Tune swerve rotation PID so that it turns quickly
Add gravity compensation to the getPitch method in PoseEstimatorSub
Tune autos, ensure Choreo constants are accurate
Tune amp scoring:
    Add stop so that pose estimation is accurate, also tune stdDevs on vision
    Potentially make less reliant on pose estimation and more reliant on a limelight crosshair
CRAZY: Add full motion shooting:
    make code that tests angles to .1 degree until it finds the most accurate one

"Done:" 
Tune Actuator to be accurate to 1 degree and be quick:
    try squaring the gravity feedforward, so its stronger at the bottom and weaker at the top
    try SYSID type stuff and find a curve of best fit
